# Get user profile and wallet addresses from Ronin Waypoint

## Overview[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/guides/get-user-profile#overview "Direct link to Overview")

This guide walks you through the steps to retrieve user information and wallet addresses associated with a Ronin Waypoint account by sending a request to the user profile endpoint. Based on the number of wallet addresses associated with the account, you can choose how to handle the wallets in your game.

## Prerequisites[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/guides/get-user-profile#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

-   An app created in the [Developer Console](https://developers.skymavis.com/console/applications/).
-   Permission to use the Sky Mavis Account service. Request in the Developer Console under **your app > App Permission > Sky Mavis Account (OAuth 2.0) > Request Access**.
-   The unique ID of the Ronin Waypoint account whose information you want to retrieve. You can retrieve this ID from the `sub` claim in the JWT token returned by Ronin Waypoint after authentication.

## Steps[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/guides/get-user-profile#steps "Direct link to Steps")

### Step 1. Understand the user's account and wallets[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/guides/get-user-profile#step-1-understand-the-users-account-and-wallets "Direct link to Step 1. Understand the user's account and wallets")

The user's Ronin Waypoint account includes the following information:

```
{  "account.wallet.default": "wallet.secondary", // Default wallet set by the user  "account.wallet.identity": "0x123...", // Keyless wallet address  "account.wallet.identity.has_backup": "true", // Whether the keyless wallet is backed up  "account.wallet.secondary": "0x456...", // Optional seed-phrase Ronin Wallet, if linked by the user  "profile.name": "Lunacian" // User's profile name}
```

Key

Description

Use for

`account.wallet.default`

The default wallet for the user's account as set by the user on the [account management](https://accounts.skymavis.com/dashboard/account) page.

Use this wallet as the primary wallet for the user's account.

`account.wallet.identity`

The user's keyless wallet created either through the [waypoint.roninchain.com](https://waypoint.roninchain.com) page, or in the Ronin Wallet mobile app or browser extension.

Treat this wallet as the user's spending account for in-game transactions and purchases, enabling the user to purchase, swap, and mint assets across Ronin games. It also supports actions like collecting daily check-ins and sending tokens or NFTs to other users.

`account.wallet.identity.has_backup`

Indicates if a shard of the keyless wallet is backed up to the Sky Mavis server.

The service will prompt the user to continue the setup process if the wallet isn't backed up.

`account.wallet.secondary`

A seed phrase Ronin Wallet that is present if the user linked it on the [account management](https://accounts.skymavis.com/dashboard/account) page.

Treat this wallet as the user's savings account for staking tokens or NFTs for rewards and governance, and storing valuable assets.

`profile.name`

The user's display name that appears in games such as Axie Infinity.

Use this name to personalize the user experience.

### Step 2. Send the request[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/guides/get-user-profile#step-2-send-the-request "Direct link to Step 2. Send the request")

To retrieve user information and wallet addresses, send a GET request to the user profile endpoint with the user ID.

warning

Make sure to send the request *server-side* to protect your API key from being exposed and misused.

Request:

```
curl --location 'https://api-gateway.skymavis.com/account/v2/rpc/get-user-profile/{user_id}' \--header 'X-api-key: {YOUR_API_KEY}' \--header 'X-app-id: {YOUR_APP_ID}'
```

Parameters:

-   `{user_id}`: the user ID of the account you want to retrieve information for. For example, `1eda5fc0-76e1-6de4-8449-b3a0fde29125`.
-   `{YOUR_API_KEY}`: your app's API key from the [Developer Console](https://developers.skymavis.com/console/applications).
-   `{YOUR_APP_ID}`: your app's unique ID from the Developer Console.

Response:

```
{  "account.wallet.default": "wallet.secondary", // Default wallet set by the user  "account.wallet.identity": "0x123...", // Keyless wallet address  "account.wallet.identity.has_backup": "true", // Whether the keyless wallet is backed up  "account.wallet.secondary": "0x456...", // Optional seed-phrase Ronin Wallet, if linked by the user  "profile.name": "Lunacian" // User's profile name}
```

### Step 3. Choose how to handle the wallets[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/guides/get-user-profile#step-3-choose-how-to-handle-the-wallets "Direct link to Step 3. Choose how to handle the wallets")

Depending on the number of wallet addresses associated with a Ronin Waypoint account, you can choose one of the following implementations:

-   **One wallet address**: query this wallet for all transactions and authentication needs.
-   **Two wallet addresses**: choose one of the following:
    -   **Query both wallets**: retrieve information from both the `identity` and `secondary` wallets.
    -   **Pick only one wallet**: prioritize the `identity` wallet over the `secondary` wallet.
    -   **Let the user choose which wallet to use**: provide an interface allowing the user to select which wallet to use.

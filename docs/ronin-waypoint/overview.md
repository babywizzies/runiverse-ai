## Ways to integrate[‚Äã](/mavis/ronin-waypoint/overview#ways-to-integrate "Direct link to Ways to integrate")

Ronin Waypoint is available in two integration options: *Standard* and *Hybrid*. The following table provides a comparison of the two options:

Category

Standard integration

Hybrid integration

Overview

Simplifies integration with account service and wallet interface for managing transaction details, recipient info, smart contracts, and sponsored gas vouchers.

Provides raw SDKs for wallet interactions (message signing and transaction sending) so a game or dApp can handle transactions without confirmation pop-ups.

Supported platforms

Unity, Android, iOS, Web, React Native

Web

Integration effort and complexity

Simpler integration, requires less effort thanks to the default Ronin Waypoint UI, and complex wallet creation, backup, security being pre-handled.

Require medium effort: first, integration with the standard Ronin Waypoint SDK to create Ronin Waypoint account and keyless wallet. Then, using the Headless Waypoint SDK to handle wallet interactions, with your own UI.

Use cases

Games with infrequent transactions, where browser pop-ups during transactions are an acceptable user experience.

Games with frequent, complex transactions and context switching, where continuous pop-ups are disruptive to the user experience.

UI and flow

Default UI and flow provided by Ronin Waypoint SDK.

Customized UI and flow, hidden Web3 interactions in the background.

Ideal for

Small to medium partners, lacking resources and solid Web3 knowledge, who are looking a quick, ready-made, low-effort integration.

Medium to large partners, with resources and solid Web3 knowledge.
